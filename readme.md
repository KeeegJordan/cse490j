	git clone git@github.com:KeeegJordan/cse490j.git

3. Use window > timeline to view animations

4. Press play to watch camera fly through

Scene List:
	Assignment1-scene: Pre assignment

The organization is simple with the first line in the heirarchy seperating the camera from the rest
The second line seperates the models & lights from the animation objects

That's it!
