Keegan Jordan's project

1. clone repository
	git clone git@github.com:KeeegJordan/cse490j.git

2. Open directory in Unity

3. Use window > timeline to view animations

4. Press play to watch camera fly through


The organization is simple with the first line in the heirarchy seperating the camera from the rest
The second line seperates the models & lights from the animation objects

That's it!
